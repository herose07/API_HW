## Retirement Analysis

The expected cumulative returns at 30 years for the following percentiles:
* 10th percentile = 2.08923
* 50th percentile = 7.622968
* 90th percentile = 29.44046

Given an initial investment of $20,000, the expected portfolio returns in dollars for the following percentiles are:
* 10th percentile = 41784.596576
* 50th percentile = 152459.353509
* 90th percentile = 588809.209971

Given the current projected annual income from the Plaid analysis, a 4% withdraw rate from the retirement portfolio does not meet or exceed the value at the 10th percentile. 

    Retirement income would be $1671.38 and current projected income is $6085.

    A 50% increase in the initial investment amount will increase the 4% retirement withdrawal from $1671.38 to $2507.07.
    This still does not meet the current projected income of $6085
