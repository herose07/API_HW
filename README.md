# Budget Analysis and Retirement Planner

## Budget Analysis

In this section of the project, I used the Plaid API to obtain transaction and account data that will be used for my budget analysis.

## Retirement Planner 

In this section of the project, I used the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio and then ran Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

* Monte Carlo Simulation of 500 runs and 30 years for the 60/40 portfolio
